## Here's an example program in Visual Basic that calculates a person's age and the number of days until their next birthday:

## This program will prompt the user for their date of birth, and then it will calculate current age, the day of the week you were born on, and the number of days until your next birthday.

## To use the program, simply run it in a IDE or code editor environment and follow the prompts.


# Version: 1.0.2
## Here is an optimized version of the program in Visual Basic: This version of the program removes the unnecessary variable inputDate and reads the input directly from Console.ReadLine() into the birthDate variable. It also calculates the age in a more concise way using a simple if statement. Finally, it calculates the daysToBirthday using the TotalDays property of the TimeSpan returned by subtracting the current date from nextBirthday.


# Version: 1.0
## Here's an example implementation of the program in Visual Basic: This implementation uses the Date type to parse and manipulate dates, and the DateDiff function to calculate the age and days to the next birthday. The DateSerial function is used to create the next birthday date based on the current year. The program also performs input validation to ensure the date is entered in the correct format.
